# Banking Marketing Data Analysis

## Objective
This project is part of the **Finalytics Course: Data Science with Python** and aims to predict client subscription to term deposits while analyzing factors that influence success. It combines Python-based data analysis and a PowerPoint presentation for insights.

## Technologies Used
- Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib)
- PowerPoint

## Dataset
- Collected from phone-based marketing campaigns (2008-2010)
- Contains 45,211 records and 18 features

## Analysis Process
1. **Data Exploration**: Understanding client demographics, financial status, and campaign details.
2. **Visualization**: Using graphs and plots for better insights.
3. **Insights and Recommendations**: Identifying key factors influencing term deposit subscriptions.

## Deliverables
- **Python Analysis Transcript:** [Code_Transcript.pdf](link-to-file)
- **Presentation:** [Analysis_Presentation.pptx](link-to-file)
- **Complete Solution:** [Case_Solution_Submission.zip](link-to-file)

## Key Insights
- **Demographics**: Majority of clients are aged between 30-40 and hold management or technician roles.
- **Financial Behavior**: ~55% have housing loans, but only ~16% have personal loans. 98.2% have no credit defaults.
- **Campaign Effectiveness**: Most contacts happen mid-month, and call duration strongly predicts subscription likelihood.

## Recommendations
1. Prioritize clients with higher call durations for better results.
2. Leverage cellular communication as it shows better engagement.
3. Reduce repeated calls; focus on the quality of engagement.

## How to Use
- Download the files and review the provided analysis.
- Use the Python script as a starting point for similar analyses or as part of your own Data Science projects.

## About the Course
